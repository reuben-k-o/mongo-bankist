# bankist-app
This is a basic bank app, that a user can track his money movements, request for a loan which is subject to be reviewed by the bank, upon meeting certain condition only then will the user be given the loan.
The user can send money to other users, as long those users too have an account, else money can't be transfered.

For demo purposes, there are three accounts
1. js pass: 1111
2. jd pass: 2222
3. stw pass: 3333

Hope you have fun using this great application!!!!!
